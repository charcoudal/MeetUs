            "about_me" : "Charlotte is a junior at Northwestern University, double majoring in Computer Science and Dance with minors in Film Studies and English Literature. Charlotte led the Peer Tutoring Program at Riverdale Country School and is now a Teacher's Assistant/ Peer Mentor for the Computer Science Department where she holds office hours, teaches weekly tutorial sessions and mentors her amazing students! She recently received the Spring 2020 Peter and Adrienne Barris Service Award for excellence in teaching. Specifically interested in Human Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, and App Development, she is also a member of WiC (Women in Computing) where she promotes her fellow Women in STEM. She sees CS as an intersection of logic and creativity â€”a fusion of math, puzzles, and art. Fluent in Spanish, Char also studied ethics, international policy, Arabic, and Mandarin in D.C. at the School for Ethics and Global Leadership. She has continued her studies with the school as a guest speaker in Shakespeare as well as a mentee of Carl Wilkens in Rwanda. Her biggest passion project is founding Mission S.P.A. (Sanitary Product Awareness), a non-profit that collects and donates sanitary products to local NYC shelters along with schools in Nepal. When Charlotte is not computing, dancing, or advocating for gender equity worldwide, she is diving for the NCAA Midwestern conference, training for triathlons, watching House and eating pierogies. Her eclectic academic interests match her enthusiastic and individualized approach to teaching, mentoring, tutoring, and learning.",
